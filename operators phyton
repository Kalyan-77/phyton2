#identity operators

a=[10,20]
b=[30,40]
c=a
print(a is c) #it will print true
print(b is a) #it will print False
print(a==b) #it will print False
print(a is not b) #it will print true

#membership operators

a=[10,20,30,40,50]
print(50  in a) #it will print true
print(30 not in a) #it will print false

#bitwise operators
x=10
y=7 
print(x&y) # & => AND => if both bits are 1, it sets each bit to 1 , otherwise 0

print(x|y) # | => OR => if one of the two bits is 1 , it sets each bit to 1 , otherwise 0 

print(x^y) # ^ => XOR => if only one of the two bits is 1 , it sets each bit to 1

print(~y) # ~ => NOT => complement operator, it returns one's complement o

print(x<<y) # << => Zero fill left shift => the binary number is appended with 0's at the end

print(x>>y) # >> => Right SHift => In simple terms, the right side of the bits are removed
