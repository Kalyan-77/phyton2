    Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers
Examples:
6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

        else:
            print(num)
            
            
            
               
  Exercise 12: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.

ANSWER:
num1, num2 = 0, 1

print("Fibonacci sequence:")
# run loop 10 times
for i in range(10):
    # print next number of a series
    print(num1, end="  ")
    # add last two numbers to get next number
    res = num1 + num2

elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    # run loop 5 times
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # multiply factorial by current number

Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690
Given:
# number of terms
n = 5

ANSWER:
n = 5
# first number of sequence
start = 2
sum_seq = 0

# run loop n times
for i in range(0, n):

    sum_seq += start
    # calculate the next term
    start = start * 10 + 2
print("\nSum of above series is:", sum_seq)

ANSWER:
rows = 5
for i in range(0, rows):
